Facial Keypoints Detection
Built a system to detect 68 distinguished keypoints; Consists of  Haar Cascade algorithm for detection of faces and textbf CNN architecture for keypoints prediction.

Trained on images from YouTube Faces DataBase by employing
Transfer Learning on Resnet-18 model Used Pytorch and OpenCV.
Files included in this repository are all .ipynb files.

1.EDA_AND_DATASET (4).ipynb
In this file ,I prerpocessed the images and transformed into modelling form with Pytorch's "DATALOADER","TRANSFORMS" functions.

2-project3.ipynb
In this modelled with resnet.

3-evaluation.ipynb
predcited the result and tested out the accuracies.

fun.ipynb and experiment.ipynb
here I experimented with my own images to get keypoints.
